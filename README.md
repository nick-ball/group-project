# group-project
## [ Nick, Robert, Patrick, Joel ] - the group
The repository that hosts everything that has to do with the group project we started for the apprenticeship program at CSCC.

### First, we conceptualized the final product, and how we are going to get there, on a whiteboard.

### Next, since I (nick ball) am the group lead, I created a functional proof of concept app and we discussed what we liked/did not like about it, as well as what was the main revisions would need to be for our final product.
